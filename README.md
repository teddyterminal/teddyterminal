### 🐻 💻 

**Every so often** - on a dreary Saturday in the middle of a pandemic, or late at night with rain lashing against the windows, or in a library sipping extra creamy coffee or matcha tea - I ask my computer to make something truly amazing that I could never have done with a pencil and paper. 

Once in a while, I think it's cool enough to share with the world.

I love coding in Python, and can get my way around R, Java, Javascript, and HTML/CSS. I'm interested in a lot of things - data science, visualization, politics, NLP, music, the meaning of life, and determining why the smallest drink at Starbucks is called a _tall_. 

Ask me about any of my projects! More stuff will be coming here soon, just as soon I figure out how to clone myself into a small army.
